Hospital System

# Project Goal
Build a system with at least 7 interconnected data entities. The system should perform a unique and well-defined function, contributing to the overall system, and contain business rules and constraints. The system should demonstrate effective functional requirement capture and communication, and reflect best practices in design. Data entities should be associated to contain many-to-many and one-to-many associations. There should be at least five non-trivial business rules.
